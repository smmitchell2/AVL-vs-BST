All you need to know about life is retained in those four walls. You will notice that one of your personalities is
seduced by the illusions of grandeur: the gold packet of kingsize with a regal insignia, an attractive implication
towards glamour and wealth, the subtle suggestion that cigarettes are indeed your royal and loyal friends  and that,
Pete, is a lie. Your other personality is trying to draw your attention to the flip side of the discussion:
written in boring bold black and white, it's a statement that these neat little soldiers of death are in fact trying
to kill you  and that, Pete, is the truth. Oh, beauty is a beguiling call to death and I'm addicted to the sweet pitch
of its siren. That that starts sweet ends bitter, and that which starts bitter ends sweet. THAT is why you and I love
the drugs and that is also why I cannot give that painting back. Now please, pass me a light. "Random Quotes CHECK".
